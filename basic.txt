Autharization -> What i can do? 

Orkut is the 1st social media application


// Project Make Coding
1. Create a node.js project
2. Define the structure 
    Back-End ->  
        a. Router  -> receptionist
        b. Controller -> waiter
        c. Model -> code
3. Auth (two type of user)
    a. admin
    b. customer

    // dependencies added
    * npm install bcrypt       -> Password encryption
    * npm install express      -> HTTP requests and responses through routing and middleware
    * npm install jsonwebtoken -> to identify an authenticated user
    * npm install mongoose     -> Data modeling

4. Create Model
    bring mongoose -> schema Create -> exports to convert into module

5. Make server.js
    require express
    require mongoose
        express is in app
        start the server -> port number in config file
        create a user where no user present
    mongoose connect in server
    make function for admin check


6. Make Config folder
    server.config.js for port number
    db.config for database => name & url

7. make api using postman -> write code for doing this

8. Create Controller 
    exports.signUp <- controller
        logic to create the user
        read the request body
        insert data in user collection
        return the response back to the user 
9. route -> it is the layer which intercept the request
    make the url using app 
    controller require

10. calling route in server.js
    now call from the postman but before that
        convert json into javaScript using express -> (middleware)

11. check in mongodb using mongosh in terminal
    already created a user using postman

12. I i want to not return the password with calling from the postman api
    goto -> auth.controller.js -> create object & pass only those data you want to see 

13. Create a middleware file
    inside this define if name, email, password, exist is not entered the failed

14. build the api for user signIn & in response we got tokens
